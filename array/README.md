Unlike other data structures asked in interviews (such as heaps, graphs, tries, etc), array is a very widely used data structure that is often used in real-life programming. I've seen many array questions in technical interviews, especially during phone interviews.

Since array is a simple data structure, the tricks to use in array problems are somewhat limited. However, these tricks are not easy to see if you have never seen them before.
