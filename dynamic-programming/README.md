Dynamic programming remembers what we have computed before so we don't have to recompute again for the same subproblem. Dynamic programming is typically used in problems that require optimization, minimization, maximization, etc.

In dynamic programming, we depend on two things: optimal substructure and overlappng subproblems. A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. Optimal substructure requires that you can solve a problem based on the solutions of subproblems. Overlapping subproblems means that when you split your problem into subproblems, you sometimes get the same subproblem multiple times. 

We can take a 3 step process to solve these dynamic programming problems. First, we solve it with recursion without any optimization. This process will often give an exponential runtime but will help us understand the problem better. Second, we update our unoptimized recursive solution with memoization. Use of memoization is top-down dynamic programming, and this will often turn our exponential runtime into polynomial of even linear. Third, we update our top-down memoized recursive solution to an iterative bottom-up dynamic programming solution.
